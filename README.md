Hello, I am now sharing the latest draft of this slide with you. I emphasized the percentage section more prominently, giving it a number-based effect. I've also made these numbers more catchy and embellished. Meanwhile, I've made the project descriptions more comprehensive and professional - at least I've tried to make them more comprehensive. Please review this new design and updated content again. By the way, I wrote these benefits and the description after reviewing the most recent proposal for Farmers Insurance, which was updated by Deepasa, in our team's TDM-related resources files. However, I could not find any percentage information related to Farmers Insurance in it. So, I kindly ask you, where can I find the percentages or numbers related to Farmers Insurance? Or do you have any other project or case study suggestions that I could use instead?
